Various programs, scripts, and so on made with [macposts].

[macposts]: https://github.com/maccmu/macposts

Currently this repository contains two sub-projects:

- `dode`: Implementation of dynamic OD demand estimation models.
- `network_builder`: Scripts for reading, modifying, and writing data files
  which can be consumed by macposts.

If some of those scripts are proved to be useful, we may consider to add them to
the core macposts library.
